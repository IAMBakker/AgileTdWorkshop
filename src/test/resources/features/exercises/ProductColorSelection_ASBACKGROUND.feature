  As a user
  I want to be able to select the product color
  So that I can add the correct color to my order

  this feature has no step definitions (yet)

  Background:
    Given I am on the Polteq Webshop
    And I go to the IPODS page
    And I go to the iPod Nano detail page

  Scenario: Selected color will be shown in the confirmation
    When    I change the color of the product to "Pink"
    And     I add the product to the cart
    Then    I get a confirmation that the product is added to the shopping cart
    And     the confirmation shows that the selected color is "Pink"

  Scenario Outline: Selecting a color will change the product image to selected color
    When I change the color of the product to "<color>"
    Then the product image will change to the color "<color>"

    Examples:
